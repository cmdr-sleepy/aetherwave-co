SPECTROGRAM GENERATION
---------------------
Implemented new audio processing pipeline (see SignalProcessor.process_audio). Key improvements:
- Dynamic window sizing
- 50% overlap for enhanced temporal resolution
- Magnitude scaling with dB conversion
- Normalized intensity mapping

Generated high-resolution spectrogram saved to: data/raw/SKtOwLOCwIc.spectrogram.png
Image properties:
- Resolution: 4500x3000
- DPI: 300
- Color mapping: Viridis (optimised for Thargoid pattern visibility)
